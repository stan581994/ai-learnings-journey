# AI Learning Playground

This repository is a personal space where I apply and practice the skills Iâ€™m learning as I begin my journey into **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  

The purpose of this repo is not to build a final product, but rather to document my progress, experiments, and learning process as I explore AI concepts, tools, and techniques.  

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Strengthen my Python and programming foundations.  
- Explore AI concepts step by step.  
- Build small experiments and projects to apply what I learn.  
- Track my progress over time.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Since this is a learning playground, the structure may evolve as I learn more. For now, expect folders such as:
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter or Colab notebooks for hands-on practice.  
- `activity/` â€“ Simple programming activities and practice exercises.

---

## âœ¨ Learning Focus
I will gradually explore:
- Python programming  
- Data handling & preprocessing  
- Machine learning basics  
- Deep learning concepts  
- AI applications

## ðŸ“– Disclaimer
This repository is purely for **learning and experimentation**. Code and notes here may be messy, incomplete, or experimental.

## ðŸ’¡ About
This is the start of my AI journey, and this repo will grow as my knowledge grows.
